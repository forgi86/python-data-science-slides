# Python tools for data science
A 10-lecture introductory course on data processing &amp; visualization with [numpy](https://numpy.org/), 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).

<!-- The course consists in 10 lectures which should last about 1.45 hours each. --> 
The lectures are [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks to be presented as slides using the [rise](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) extension.
Each lecture is accompanied by exercises with solutions.
